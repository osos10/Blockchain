# Blockchain Workshop
# Introduction
Blockchain technology introduces a decentralized and immutable ledger that enables secure and transparent transactions without intermediaries. This project provides a practical guide to building a blockchain from scratch using Java and Spring Boot.

# Features
* Basic blockchain implementation with blocks and transactions.
* Transaction pool for managing pending transactions.
* Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.
* Blockchain validation and integrity checks.
* Wallet management including key pair generation and transaction signing.
# Installation
## Prerequisites
Java 17 or higher
Maven
## Steps
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Osos10/blockchain.git
cd blockchain
```
Build the project:
```
mvn clean install
```
# Usage
## Running the Application
Navigate to the `target` directory:
```
cd target
```
Run the application:
```
java -cp blockchain-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Main
```
# Application Menu
The application provides a terminal-based menu for interacting with the blockchain:

1. Add a New Transaction

- Prompts for sender, recipient, and amount to create a new transaction.
- Example:
```
Enter sender address: Ossama
Enter recipient address: Ayoub
Enter amount: 200
Transaction added to the pool
```
2. Mine a New Block

- Mines a new block including pending transactions and adds it to the blockchain.
- Example:
```
Enter miner address: Osos-Miner
Mining...
Block mined successfully and added to the blockchain.
```
3. Display the Blockchain

- Displays the current state of the blockchain.
- Example:
```
Block 0 [previousHash: 0, currentHash: abc123, data: Genesis Block]
Block 1 [previousHash: abc123, currentHash: def456, data: Transactions]
```
4. Validate the Blockchain

- Validates the integrity of the blockchain.
- Example:
```
Blockchain is valid.
```
5. Show Wallet Public Key

- Displays the public key of the wallet.
- Example:
```
Wallet Public Key: MFYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEAAoDQgAE1L...
```
6. Exit

- Exits the application.
# Testing the Application
## Adding a Transaction
1. Select option 1 from the menu.
2. Enter the sender address, recipient address, and amount.
3. The transaction is added to the transaction pool.
## Mining a Block
1. Select option 2 from the menu.
2. Enter the miner's address.
3. A new block is mined and added to the blockchain, and the miner receives a reward.
## Displaying the Blockchain
1. Select option 3 from the menu.
2. The blockchain's current state is printed to the console.
## Validating the Blockchain
1. Select option 4 from the menu.
2. The application checks the integrity of the blockchain and reports if it is valid or not.
## Showing Wallet Public Key
1. Select option 5 from the menu.
2. The public key of the wallet is displayed.
